# 📱 Personal Chatbot from WhatsApp History

This project builds a personalized AI chatbot trained on your own WhatsApp conversations. It mimics your texting style and runs entirely locally on your computer with an RTX 4050 GPU — no cloud access, no data sharing.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

- **Input**: WhatsApp chats you export  
- **Output**: A chatbot that sounds and types like you  
- **Hardware Required**: A laptop with an NVIDIA RTX 4050, Ryzen 7 processor, and 16GB RAM  
- **Deployment**: Lightweight and offline-ready AI chatbot

## ✅ Step-by-Step Workflow

### 🧾 Phase 1: Data Preparation
1. Export relevant WhatsApp chat histories without media attachments.  
2. Organize the exported chat files into appropriate folders.  
3. Clean the chat data to isolate your own messages.  
4. Create structured conversations with prompt-response pairs for training.  

### ⚙️ Phase 2: Environment Setup
1. Ensure GPU drivers are installed and up to date.  
2. Set up a clean Python environment for the project.  
3. Install all essential AI libraries and tools for local model training.  
4. Choose a lightweight open-source language model for fine-tuning.  

### 🧪 Phase 3: Model Fine-Tuning
1. Use your cleaned conversation data to fine-tune the base model.  
2. Train the model using efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA) techniques.  
3. Save the trained model into a usable form for local deployment.  
4. Monitor hardware usage to ensure smooth training.  

### 🗜️ Phase 4: Deployment & Testing
1. Compress and optimize the trained model to run efficiently on your CPU.  
2. Set up a local user interface (either command line or browser-based).  
3. Add session memory so the chatbot can remember past messages.  
4. Thoroughly test the chatbot’s output and personality for accuracy.
